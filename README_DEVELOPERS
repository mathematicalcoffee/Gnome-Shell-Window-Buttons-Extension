There are four branches:
* master          [dev for gnome3.4+]
* gnome3.4        [stable for gnome3.4+ (--3.6 currently)]
* gnome3.2        [stable for gnome3.2]
* gnome3.2-dev    [dev for gnome3.2]

The gnome3.2 and gnome3.4 branches are where the *stable* code for these respective versions of the extension live. They are quite different (for example GNOME 3.4 version can use gnome-shell-extension-prefs, whereas GNOME 3.2 you're stuck with editing the extensin.js file).

The master branch is for DEVELOPMENT of GNOME 3.4+ code. Push to branch gnome3.4+ when stable.

The gnome3.2-dev branch is for DEVELOPMENT of GNOME 3.2 code. Push to branch gnome3.2 when stable.

I can't quite remember how pushing between gnome3.2-dev and master works (i.e. applying universal changes to both branches)... I'm sure doing it in one direction will work better than the other but this currently escapes me.

Note - the way I (m.c) am playing it at the moment is as follows: mathematicalcoffee fork of this extension is where development happens, and it all then gets pushed to the biox repository.
